# Dark Messiah Restoration Mod Files
The mod files for the DM Restoration Mod. This is the final set of files, not compliable code.

## Dependencies
wiltOS Dark Messiah Mod Launcher [Download](https://www.moddb.com/games/dark-messiah-of-might-magic/downloads)

wiltOS Dark Messiah Advanced SDK Base Module [Download](https://github.com/KingDavidW/DarkMessiah-AdvancedSDK-Mod-Files)

## How to Install
Make sure you have the wiltOS Dark Messiah Mod Launcher installed!

Go to the **_mods** folder in your Dark Messiah game, and create a new folder titled **restoration_mod**

Take the files from this repository and extract them into that folder.

## Mod Order Requirement
Make the Advanced SDK the first mod in your list, above everything else.

## Recommended Installation
The best way to install this mod is by actually doing a git checkout to that **restoration_mod** folder. That way, as this mod updates, you can just download the changes instead of redownloading the whole repository. I recommend [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to make it easier, but it is entirely up to you.
